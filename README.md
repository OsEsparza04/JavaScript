# JavaScript for CodeNewbies 
codeNewbie

Let´s say that this repository was created in order to practice, performing  the repetition workout, the fundamental concepts that every programmer must master in order to code fluently. Among this concepts, I´m considering practicing how to declare functions(different variants), how to declare arrays and iterate over them, how to create loops, how to create classes and objects, and so on....in the JS language.  

I´m going to share with you how I´m doing this stuff by performing these exercises until I feel comfortable on doing this without reviewing notes. 

HERE´S THE KEY MISSION: INTEGRATE KNOWLEDGE BY PERFORMING REPETITION. COMPLETING EXERCISES OVER THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PROGRAMMING IN JAVA SCRIPTS. 

I HOPE THIS COULD BE USEFUL FOR YOU: CODEWARRIOR
